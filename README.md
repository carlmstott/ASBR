# ASBR

## To do
- Delete MexpB.m, MexpS.s - **B**
- Make changes to use matExpRodrigues and transMatExpScrew - **B & C**
      -Every function that used MexpB needs to instead used MatExpRodriguez and Matrixexponentalscrewfunction
- FK_body should take in robot and theta. Theta should not be a part of the robot but should rather be coming in from the main file (demo)-**C** 
- Make test cases for all functions - **B & C**
